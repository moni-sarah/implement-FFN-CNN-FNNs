# Deep Learning Practice Activity: FNN, CNN, and RNN

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and training of three different deep learning architectures using TensorFlow and Keras:
- Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) on the Iris dataset
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on synthetic sine wave data

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy
   ```

2. Run the Python scripts for each model (to be created):
   - `fnn_iris.py` for FNN
   - `cnn_cifar10.py` for CNN
   - `rnn_sine.py` for RNN

## Files
- `fnn_iris.py`: Feedforward Neural Network for Iris classification
- `cnn_cifar10.py`: Convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-10 image classification
- `rnn_sine.py`: Recurrent Neural Network for sine wave prediction

## Results
After running each script, compare the following metrics:
- FNN: Classification accuracy on the Iris dataset
- CNN: Classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- RNN: Mean squared error for sine wave prediction
